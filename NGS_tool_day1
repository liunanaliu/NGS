coverage is the number of times (on average) you read each base in your template :
+ number of samples,
+ number of reads

deep coverage (high coverage values) can compensate for many sins by your sequence,
you can sacrifice coverage depth to increase the number of sample per lane.

replicate :
+ technical replicate = sequence of the same sample twice,usually not required
+ biological replicate =  sequence several individuals that represent the same biological condition.

sequence is a measurement technique with high technical reproducibility (R square are typically > 0.97)

sample preparation :
adaptor ligation - size selection - QC and quantification - sequence library

#single sample per lane or multiplexed :
multiplexed libraries distribute the sample across lanes, this allows you to use sequencing more 
efficiently an minimize technical artifacts associated with lane-specificity.
multiplexing is achieved by using sample specific adaptors in library preparation step, then sequencing them
all together in one lane.
N - number of multiplex samples
F - number of reads per lane (or unit)
C - number of raw reads you need per sample
Nmax = F / C


#standard or unstandard : 
standary libraries provide information on the strand that the original molecule came from, therefore allowing 
you to disentangle transcriptions of overlapping genes, and more accurate sample QC.

# polyA or riboDepletion :
ribosomal RNA constitutes > 70% of the purified total RNA, riboDepletion removes specificity ribosomal RNA,
leavinng all other RNA transcripts, however, it is not 100% efficient, 
polyA selection is very efficient, but it will only select polyadenylated RNA, therefore many long, non-coding
RNAs will be lost.

#paired-end (PE) or single-end (SE) libraries
PE has more information on discovery, including
new splice variants, new structural variation, more per base coverage, typically better mapping (~5%),
while less information on quantification,
the 2nd fragment is redundant information for coverage purpose.

library prep always involves the ligation of adapter sequence :
# may involove some form of postive or negative selection, including
removal of rRNA,
capture of exons and mRNA, 
ChIP.

#may be strand, to detect RNA from two overlapping, anti-parallel genes.

#may be multiplexed, using barcodes to have multiple samples in a single lane.

what information do i want to get?
# differential expression - SE
# alternative splicing - PE
# structral variants - PE

potential bias: pooling the samples

choose the right application for your question :
# genetic variant - DNAseq, Exome.
# quantification (expression, protein-DNA binding, regulation of expression) - RNAseq, miRNA, ChIPseq, BSseq
